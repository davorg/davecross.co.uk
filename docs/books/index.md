## Data Munging With Perl

[[Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/data-munging-with-perl), Jan 2001]

An ancient book about data manipulation with Perl. Possibly the first technical
book with "munging" in the title.

It's out of print now, but you can download a PDF from
[datamungingwithperl.com](https://datamungingwithperl.com/).

## Perl Template Toolkit

[[O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/perl-template-toolkit/0596004761/), Dec 2003]

I was one of three authors on the only book about Perl's defacto standard
templating engine. It's almost twenty years old, but still holds up pretty
well.

## Eighteen Classic Albums

[Self-published, Nov 2015]

Something a bit different. Many years ago, I was in a music club (like a
reading group - but listening to music). We listened to a number of
"classic" albums and shared our opinions with each other. I collected my
thoughts and shared them in an eBook.

## Perl Taster

[[Perl School](https://perlschool.com/books/perl-taster/), Nov 2017]

A very basic introduction to programming in Perl. The subtitle is "Your
First Two Hours With Perl" - and that pretty much sums it up.

## The Best of Perl Hacks

[[Perl School](https://perlschool.com/books/the-best-of-perl-hacks/), Apr 2020]

I've been writing a blog about Perl programming over at
[Perl Hacks](https://perlhacks.com/) for years. During the Covid lockdown,
I collected my favourite posts into an eBook.

## George and the Smart Home

[[Self-published](https://george.davecross.co.uk/), Mar 2022]

And now for something completely different. I wrote a children's book.
George lives in a smart home, but nothing works for him. The book traces
his adventures as he works out how to control the smart speakers in his
home.

## GitHub Actions Essentials

[[Clapham Technical Press](https://actions.davecross.co.uk/), Apr 2023]

Moving away from Perl, I've become fascinated by what you can do with
GitHub Actions. And this book is a brain-dump of everything I've learned
in this area over the last few years.

# Publishing

I'm the publisher at [Perl School](https://perlschool.com/) a boutique
publishing house that publishing books about Perl programming.

I'm in the process of extending that idea to
[Clapham Technical Press](https://claphamtechpress.com/) which will
do the same thing for the wider technical community.
