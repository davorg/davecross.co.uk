# Books

I've written a few books over the last few years.

## Data Munging With Perl

<img src="/img/dmp.jpg" class="cover" alt="Data Munging with Perl">

An ancient book about data manipulation with Perl. Possibly the first technical
book with "munging" in the title.

It's out of print now, but you can download a PDF from
[datamungingwithperl.com](https://datamunginfwithperl.com/).

## Perl Template Toolkit

![Perl Template Toolkit](/img/ptt.jpg)

I was one of three authors on the only book about Perl's defacto standard
templating engine. It's almost twenty years old, but still holds up pretty
well.

## Eighteen Classic Albums

![Eighhteen Classic Albums](/img/eca.jpg)

Something a bit different. Many years ago, I was in a music club (like a
reading group - but listening to music). We listened to a number of
"classic" albums and shared our opinions with each other. I collected my
thoughts and shared them in an eBook.

## Perl Taster

![Perl Taster](/img/pt.jpg)

A very basic introduction to programming in Perl. The subtitle is "Your
First Two Hours With Perl" - and that pretty much sums it up.

## The Best of Perl Hacks

![The Best of Perl Hacks](/img/bph.jpg)

I've been writing a blog about Perl programming over at
[Perl Hacks](https://perlhacks.com/) for years. During the Covid lockdown,
I collected my favourite posts into an eBook.

## George and the Smart Home

![George and the Smart Home](/img/gsh.jpg)

And now for something completely different. I wrote a children's book.
George lives in a smart home, but nothing works for him. The book traces
his adventures as he works out how to control the smart speakers in his
home.

# Publishing

I'm the publisher at [Perl School](https://perlschool.com/) a boutique
publishing house that publishing books about Perl programming.

I'm in the process of extending that idea to
[Clapham Technical Press](https://claphamtechpress.com/) which will
do the same thing for the wider technical community.
