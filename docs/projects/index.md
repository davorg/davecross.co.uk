# Projects

This page has a list of projects that I've written that you may of heard of.

## TwittElection

[TwittElection](https://twittelection.co.uk/) is a site that wakes up
whenever there is a general election in the UK. We build a Twitter
list for every parliamentary constituency which includes the Twitter
account of every candidate in that constituency.

## Line of Succession

[Line of Succession](https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/) is a site that will
show you the first thirty names in the line of succession to the British
throne on any date in the last 180 years.

## Perl School / Clapham Technical Press

[Perl School](https://perlschool.com/) is a publishing company that helps
Perl developers write and publish ebooks about Perl. I'm just in the
process of expanding those ideas to cover other technologies at
[Clapham Technical Press](https://claphamtechpress.com/).

## Perlanet

[Perlanet](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Perlanet/bin/perlanet) is
a tool that aggregates web feeds to create web sites. Sites like this were
really popular fifteen years ago (ask your parents :-)). We used to call
them "planets" (after the apparently now defunct Python software that
started the trend). I also run
[The Planetarium](https://theplanetarium.org/) which showcases some of the
planets that I've built (and didn't my life get easier when I worked out
[how to use GitHub Actions](https://dev.to/davorg/github-actions-for-semi-static-web-sites-597g)
to automate building those sites on a schedule).

## Tower Bridge Data

I got annoyed by the fact that information about when Tower Bridge was
going to lift wasn't easily available in machine-readable format. So
I [made a site](https://towerbridge.dave.org.uk/) which did just that.

## CPAN Dashboard

[CPAN](https://metacpan.org/) is a site where Perl programmers can download
thousands of extension libraries to add into their projects. My
[CPAN Dashboard](https://cpandashboard.com/) allows the authors of those
extensions to monitor the various Continuous Integration services that
they use. For example, here's
[my dashboard](https://cpandashboard.com/DAVECROSS/).

## Apollo 11 at 50

[@apollo11at50](https://twitter.com/apollo11at50) is a Twitterbot which
retweeted the Apollo 11 mission timeline in real time (timeshifted by
fifty years) in July and August 2019.

## BBC Radio Streams

Many years ago the [BBC Radio Streams project](https://dave.org.uk/streams)
scraped a lot of data from the BBC Radio web site, extracting information
about radio streams and presented them in a way that was more useful for
many users.

This project was closed down once the Radio iPlayer made accessing the
content far easier for most users.
