# Projects

This page has a list of projects that I've written that you may of heard of.

## Apollo 11 at 50

[@apollo11at50](https://twitter.com/apollo11at50) is a Twitterbot which
retweeted the Apollo 11 mission timeline in real time (timeshifted by
fifty years) in July and August 2019.

## TwittElection

[TwittElection](https://twittelection.co.uk/) is a site that wakes up
whenever there is a general election in the UK. We build a Twitter
list for every parliamentary constituency which includes the Twitter
account of every candidate in that constituency.

## BBC Radio Streams

Many years ago the [BBC Radio Streams project](https://dave.org.uk/streams)
scrapped a lot of data from the BBC Radio web site, extracting information
about radio streams and presenting them in a way that was more useful for
many users.

This project was closed down many years ago, once the Radio iPlayer made
accessing the contect far easier for most users.
