If you like what you see, there are a few ways that I can provide services
to you in exchange for money that I can then use to pay my mortgage and
buy toys.

### Short-term consultancy

Three days, two weeks, maybe even a month or so. I'd be happy to work
on your project for a while. Maybe you just need an external perspective
to kickstart your project. Or perhaps you can use a brief injection of
experience and deep knowledge.

Areas where I can add value include:

<i class="service-icon fa-solid fa-dollar-sign"></i> **Perl:** There are still quite a lot of Perl codebases out there. And,
in my experience, many of them haven't really kept up to date with modern
software engineering practices. Which version of Perl are you using? When
did you last update your technical stack? How good is your test coverage?
And, let's be honest, is your lack of test coverage preventing you from
updating your software? Let me design and implement a plan to get you back
up to date.

<i class="service-icon fa-solid fa-code-branch"></i> **Source code control:** You should be using GitHub (or something similar).
I realise that you're too busy improving your product to spend time moving
your code to a new code repository. Let me manage that project for you.
And, if necessary, I'll also train your team in the new system.

<i class="service-icon fa-solid fa-cloud"></i> **Cloud computing:** I know, I know. You want to move everything to AWS -
you just don't have the time. Let me plan out the migration. And when it's
done, we'll just pretend you've been in the cloud for the last five years.

<i class="service-icon fa-solid fa-rocket"></i> **Continous integration/Continous deployment:** I understand. That's just
one more improvement that you just haven't had the time to get around to.
How sure are you that each commit to your codebase hasn't broken something?
Is your release procedure a wiki page listing twenty-five manual steps? Do
your team understand the difference between a deployment and a release? Let
me help streamline and automate your processes.

<i class="service-icon fa-solid fa-search"></i> **Technical SEO:** Google is the most important visitor to your site. I
can help make your site as attractive as possible to Google by fixing your
canonical links, adding JSON-LD or other low-level technical fixes.

<i class="service-icon fa-solid fa-book-open"></i> **E-Books:** I've published several e-books over the last few years and
would love to help you get yours published too.

<i class="service-icon fa-solid fa-user-graduate"></i> **Mentoring:** I've been doing this for a very long time (my first
job as a developer was in 1988). I'd love to share my experience with you
and your team.

### Retainer

All of the above services, but on a retainer basis. Purchase a small number
of days each month for ongoing support.

### Training

All of the above, but let me train your team in these skills so you don't
need me anymore.

## Other alternatives

Maybe we don't need an ongoing commercial relationship. Maybe I can help in
other ways.

* Maybe just buying one of [my books](https://davecross.co.uk/books/) would
be enough.

* If you find my Open Source software or my work in the Perl community to
be useful, then maybe you'd like to
[sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/davorg) to do more of that kind
of work.

## Contact

If there's any way you think I could be useful to you (or if you just want
to talk about how me might be able to work together) then why not just
drop me an email - [hello@davecross.co.uk](mailto:hello@davecross.co.uk).
