title: Elsewhere on the web
---

I spend a fair amount of time building things on the web. This site is the hub, but there are a few other places where you can find my talks, guides, and side projects.

## Speaking and conferences

- **[Talks](https://talks.davecross.co.uk/)**  
  Slides, code and notes from conference talks, user group sessions, and workshops. If you’ve seen me speak and want to revisit a talk (or share it with a colleague), this is the place to start.

## Guides and long-form resources

- **[What to Ask Your Website Company](https://websiteguide.davecross.co.uk/)**  
  The full web version of my book *What to Ask Your Website Company*. It’s aimed at small business owners who need a website but don’t want to be bamboozled by jargon or upsold into something they don’t need. It walks through the questions you should ask, the red flags to look out for, and the basics you need to understand so you don’t get ripped off by cowboy web developers.

## Ongoing projects

- **[Modern CSS Daily](https://modern-css.davecross.co.uk/)**  
  A daily look at “modern” CSS features (roughly the last twenty years) with short, focused examples. Ideal if you last seriously looked at CSS some time ago and would like to catch up without wading through a textbook.

## Everything else

- **[Links](https://links.davecross.co.uk/)**  
  A simple link hub with more places to find me and my work around the web.

If you’d like to work together, the easiest way to reach me is still the [contact form on this site](/contact/). You’ll also find an RSS/Atom feed and other useful bits down in the footer.
