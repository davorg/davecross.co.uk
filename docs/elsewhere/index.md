title: Elsewhere on the web
---

I spend a fair amount of time building things on the web. This site is the main
hub, but there are a few other places where you can find my talks, guides, and
side projects.

## Speaking and conferences

- **[Talks](https://talks.davecross.co.uk/)**  
  Slides, code and notes from conference talks, user group sessions, and 
  workshops. If you’ve seen me speak and want to revisit a talk (or share it 
  with a colleague), this is the place to start.

## Guides and long-form resources

- **[What to Ask Your Website Company](https://websiteguide.davecross.co.uk/)**
  The full web version of my book *What to Ask Your Website Company*. It’s 
  aimed at small business owners who need a website but don’t want to be
  bamboozled by jargon or upsold into something they don’t need. It walks
  through the questions you should ask, the red flags to look out for, and
  the basics you need to understand so you don’t get ripped off by cowboy
  web developers.

## Curated Book & Music Hubs

Over the years I’ve built a few niche sites that go deep on books and music
and compilations I care about. They aim to be helpful first – with proper
information, context and links – and, where it makes sense, they include
Amazon links that use my Associates ID. If you happen to buy via those links,
Amazon shares a small commission with me, but the price you pay is exactly
the same.

- **[ReadABooker](https://readabooker.com/)**   
  Lists of short-listed and prize-winning Booker Prize books.

- **[Mercurial Albums](https://mercurialalbums.com/)**   
  The albums that have been shortlisted and won the Mercury Prize.

- **[Cooking Vinyl Compilations](https://cookingvinyl.dave.org.uk/)**   
  A list of compilation albums produced by Cooking Vinyl Records.

## Ongoing projects

- **[Modern CSS Daily](https://modern-css.davecross.co.uk/)**  
  A daily look at “modern” CSS features (roughly the last twenty years) with short, focused examples. Ideal if you last seriously looked at CSS some time ago and would like to catch up without wading through a textbook.

## Everything else

- **[Links](https://links.davecross.co.uk/)**  
  A simple link hub with more places to find me and my work around the web.
