# Dave Cross – Employment Enquiries

From January 2020 I am working on my own projects and therefore won’t be
looking for any more contracts for the foreseeable future. The information
below is left there purely for historical reasons.

----

The skills I am particularly interested in using are:

* Perl (including Moose/Moo, DBIx::Class. PSGI and various web frameworks)
* Relational databases (especially MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and Sybase)
* Unix/Linux
* Apache
* Training
* Javascript (a bit of jQuery – would love to do more)
* HTML/CSS (but I’m really not a web designer)
* XML/XPath

Skills that I don’t have that, for some reason, agents often think that I do
have:

* Java
* C++
* PowerBuilder
* SAP

The SAP example is particularly interesting. On my CV it says “Perl scripts
communicated with SAP using an XML interface”. That’s from a one-month
contract in March 2002. I should probably remove it, but it’s a useful
filter. Any agent who uses that as a basis for contacting me about SAP roles
is clearly incapable of reading a CV and can safely be ignored.

I’m only interested in roles that are based in London. That’s roles that I
can travel to from Clapham using public transport in less than an hour.

I’m only interested in contract roles. Please don’t contact me about permanent
jobs.

## CV

[Download my CV here.](/cv/data/)

Any other CV that you might have is out of date and I’d rather you got
rid of it.

It’s worth noting that I get most of my work by word of mouth, so it’s
common for my CV to be a couple of jobs out of date. Email me if you want
more details.
