title: Dave Cross - Employment Enquiries
---

I'm semi-retired and only take on occasional work if I'm offered something
particularly interesting.

----

The skills I am particularly interested in using are:

* Perl (including Moose/Moo, DBIx::Class. PSGI and various web frameworks)
* Relational databases (especially PostgreSQL, SQLite and MariaDB)
* Git and GitHub (including GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions)
* Unix/Linux
* Training
* Javascript
* HTML/CSS (but I’m really not a web designer)

Skills that I don’t have that, for some reason, agents often think that I do
have:

* Java
* C++
* PowerBuilder (honestly, I can't even remember what that was)
* SAP

The SAP example is particularly interesting. On my CV it used to say
“Perl scripts communicated with SAP using an XML interface”. That’s from
a one-month contract in March 2002. I've removed it now, but while it was
there it was a useful filter. Any agent who uses that as a basis for 
ontacting me about SAP roles is clearly incapable of reading a CV and can
safely be ignored.

* I’m only interested in fully-remote roles
* I’m only interested in contract roles. Please don’t contact me about permanent
jobs
* I would prefer to work on a part-time basis. No more than three days a week

## CV

[Download my CV here.](/cv/data/)

Any other CV that you might have is out of date and I’d rather you got
rid of it.

It’s worth noting that I get most of my work by word of mouth, so it’s
common for my CV to be a couple of jobs out of date. Email me if you want
more details.
