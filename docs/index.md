**You might be here to read about my [/2020-vision](2020 Vision projects).**

Hi, I'm [@davorg](https://twitter.com/davorg) on Twitter, where my bio
describes me as:

> Geek, Fintech, SEO, Lefty. Feminist, Atheist. Skeptic. Rationalist. Secularist. Humanist. Republican (UK Meaning!). Londoner. Music lover. Writer. Genealogist.

... which probably about covers it.

Mostly, I make things from software. My day job is working for a London
Fintech company but I've also made things like
<a href="https://twitter.com/apollo11at40">Apollo 11 at 50</a>, [Line of Succession](https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/) and
<a href="https://twittelection.co.uk/">TwittElection</a>. If you're interested, you can [read more about those projects](/projects/).

My programming language of choice is Perl and I blog about it at
<a href="https://perlhacks.com/">Perl Hacks</a>. I'm a frequent speaker
at conferences about Perl or other open source technologies.

Outside of work (and if I'm not working on one of my personal projects), I'll
be <a href="https://songkick.com/users/davorg/">at a gig</a>, watching a
film or researching my family tree.
