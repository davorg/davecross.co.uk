## Dave Cross

![Dave Cross](/img/dc-cartoon.png)

Hi, I'm [@davorg](https://links.davecross.co.uk/) on most social media, where my bio
describes me as:

> Geek, Fintech, SEO, Lefty. Feminist, Atheist. Skeptic. Rationalist. Secularist. Humanist. Republican (UK Meaning!). Londoner. Music lover. Writer. Genealogist.

... which probably about covers it.

Mostly, I make things from software. I've been a freelancer developer since 1995, but I recently gave that up
to concentrate on my own projects.

I've made things like
[Apollo 11 at 50](https://twitter.com/apollo11at50)
(which tweeted the Apollo 11 mission status in real time, fifty years after
the mission),
 [Line of Succession](https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/)
(which shows a snapshot of the line of succession to the British throne on
any date since 1820)
and
[TwittElection](https://twittelection.co.uk/)
(which automatically constructed Twitter lists for the candidates in
each constituency in UK general elections - until Elon Musk's changes
to the Twitter API made it too expensive to run). If you're interested,
you can [read more about those projects](/projects/) and others.

My programming language of choice is Perl and I blog about it at
[Perl Hacks](https://perlhacks.com/). I'm
[a frequent speaker](https://talks.davecross.co.uk/)
at conferences about Perl and other open source technologies.

Recently, I wrote
[a guide to getting a website that's useful for your business](https://websiteguide.davecross.co.uk/).
It's aimed at small business owners and shows them the kinds of questions
they should be asking website companies in order to avoid paying too much
for a website that doesn't work for them.

I've written [a few books](/books/).

Outside of work (and if I'm not working on one of my personal projects), I'll
be [at a gig](https://songkick.com/users/davorg), 
[watching a film](https://letterboxd.com/realdavorg) or researching my family tree.
