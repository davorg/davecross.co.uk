# 2020 Vision

Over on my main blog, in December, I
[wrote about my plans for 2020](https://blog.dave.org.uk/2019/12/2020-vision.html).
I've left my job and I'm going to spend (at least) the first six months of the year
trying to take a number of my web site ideas and turn them into viable businesses.

I plan to write about what I'm doing each week. So here's are my weekly reports.

## January - Line of Succession

I'm starting by doing some work on a site called [Line of Succession](https://lineofsuccession.co.uk/).
This is a site that has existed for some time (you may have seen the video of me
[giving a talk about it](https://blog.lineofsuccession.co.uk/talk/) to the London Perl Mongers.

The decision to go with an existing site for the first month was deliberate.
One of the ideas behind this whole project is that I get to learn new skills
and by choosing Line of Succession for the first month, I don't have an
excuse to spend the whole month working on technical stuff and ignoring
the other parts of the project. I'm forced to spend most of my time
working outside of my comfort zone. In this case, the thing that the
site really needs is marketing. And I know almost nothing about
marketing. So what have I been doing?
